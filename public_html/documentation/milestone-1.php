						<h1> Persona </h1>
							<p> <strong>Name:</strong> Penelope Perez-Schmidt</p>
							<p> <strong>Age:</strong> 37</p>
							<p> <strong>Profession:</strong> Small Business Owner</p>
							<p> <strong>Technology:</strong> As a small business owner, Ms. Perez-Schmidt is up to date on relatively recent point of sale technology.
								She uses a Windows-based personal computer for record keeping in her office. She is able to track sales from home on her Windows laptop. Both
								are running Windows 10. She can also track sales from her Samsung Galaxy S8, running Android Oreo (8.0), using the point of sale technology. </p>
							<p> <strong>Attitudes & Behaviors:</strong> Because of the nature of small business, Penelope does not have time to wade through excessive amounts of information and
								wants to be able to determine whether or not a programmer is a good candidate based on the design of their own site. She may look at Twitter and LinkinIn to see if the
								candidate conducts themselves professionally, as well.</p>
							<p> <strong>Frustrations & Needs:</strong> Penelope needs someone who is affordable and up front about their skills. She is looking for a
								realistic deployment strategy with no-nonsense individual who can get the job done. She wants someone who can develop her site in a way that accurately and
								professionally represents her brand and her product.</p>
							<p> <strong>Goals:</strong> Penelope wants to be able to look at a developer's personal page to quickly determine whether or not this person
								is a good candidate for a sit-down to talk about vision. She realizes that she will not be able to determine personality, per se, but wants to save time by having
								all the design features she is looking for easily represented on the candidate's page, and to be able to contact them for an interview. </p>
							<p> <strong>User Story:</strong> As a user I need to determine whether a potential candidate is a good fit to showcase my products and  accurately represent my company's culture and services.</p>
