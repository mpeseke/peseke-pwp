# Milestone1
## Specifications
Great job on Milestone1, you met all the specifications laid out in the documentation. Your HTML is standards compliant.  The directory structure matches what was outlined. Finally, the content is straightforward and I am able to identify what you want to accomplish and who is your target audience.

# Milestone 2a
## Overall Feedback
Awesome job on Milestone2a. Directory structure, Html, Git history, and content are superb. This is the quality of work I would expect out of a jr developer working underneath me. The road map you laid out for yourself in Milestone2a will be extremely beneficial when you start development.
### Wireframes
Your Wireframes are clear and easy to understand. With a quick glance I am able to tell what you hope to accomplish and have a clear vision of what your website will look like. The Mobile and Desktop wireframes match and are clearly of the same site(which should translate nicely bootstrap4).
### Content Strategy 
The Content Strategy is clear and complements your wireframes nicely. I have a clear understanding of what you hope to accomplish.
## Design Tips
Something you may want to consider is not having a footer at all but instead have a button on the bottom side of your mobile view that takes you to the top of the page. Your image carousel should be easy to accomplish using third party plugins. I personally recommend using FancyBox3 since it is easy to use asnd previous students have great success using it in the past.
